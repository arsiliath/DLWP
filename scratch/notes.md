## Lab 2:

The only issue I ran into was that I was unable to get to 100% most times, even doing 1024 units and 20 epochs. Because the lab example did get to 100%, I was trying to figure out what I was doing wrong, but I think it's more because of randomness. Sometimes it goes to 100, sometimes not. 

So perhaps the wording could be 99% instead of 100%.
